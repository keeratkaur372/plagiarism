            <h2>What is Plagiarism?</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Plagiarism</span> is the practice of taking someone else's work, ideas, or words and presenting them as your own without proper acknowledgment or citation. It represents a serious breach of academic and professional integrity that can occur in various forms across different contexts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Plagiarism can range from copying entire texts verbatim to paraphrasing someone's ideas without attribution, self-plagiarism (reusing your own previously published work), and even purchasing papers from essay mills. In the digital age, plagiarism has become easier to commit but also easier to detect through sophisticated software tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fundamental principle behind plagiarism prevention is giving proper credit where credit is due. This maintains the integrity of academic discourse, protects intellectual property rights, and ensures that original creators receive recognition for their contributions to knowledge and creativity.
